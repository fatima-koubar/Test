 I have a project with angular 19, I want to add a new type ApplePay session; so I created a file named globals.d.ts in /lib, and I added the path in tsconfig.lib.json like this: 
 "include": ["lib/**/*.ts", "lib/**/*.d.ts", "lib/*.d.ts"]
 and I added this code inside globals.d.ts
 
 export {};

declare global {
  interface Window {
   ApplePaySession: {
      canMakePayments(): boolean;
	}
  }
}

and in my ts file, I added this code: 
canApplePayPayment(): boolean {
    return window.ApplePaySession.canMakePayments();
  }
  
  When I start the build, I have this error:
  error TS2339: Property 'ApplePaySession' does not exist on type 'Window & typeof globalThis'.
   window.ApplePaySession.canMakePayments()
   
   The error is generated in the terminal when starting the build, I dont see any error in my IDE
